This project is a Blockchain decentralized ride-hailing platform that empowers the value creators and extractors within its ecosystem.
In this model, both the driver and passenger will get their freedom back and their voices heard. 
The dynamic pricing model and provisional patented negotiation model helps not only in bringing transparency but also in creating trust between customers and their drivers.

The objectives of decentralized taxi service are to:

	Monopoly of Ola/Uber : To eradicate the monopoly of Ola, Uber, and other mobility giants companies in India.

	Income: To remove drivers' dependency on companies for their annual or monthly pay salary (They will be earning as if it's their own business as there will be no commission earned by the company earned amount will be transferred to drivers' account).

	Economical: To benefit the rider spend less

	Reduce costs: Decentralized taxi services aim to remove intermediaries and reduce costs, which can lead to more affordable transportation options for riders and more income for drivers.

	Increase transparency and accountability: Decentralized taxi services aim to provide more transparent and accountable systems by using blockchain technology to manage transactions and enforce rules.

	Create a more democratic and decentralized system: Decentralized taxi services aim to create more democratic and decentralized systems, where drivers and riders have more control over the network.

	Provide more flexible and accessible transportation options: Decentralized taxi services aim to provide more flexible and accessible transportation options by allowing drivers and riders to connect directly.

	Improve safety and security: Decentralized taxi services aim to improve safety and security by using blockchain technology to manage transactions and ensure the reliability and security of the network.

	Foster innovation: Decentralized taxi services aim to foster innovation by allowing developers to create new applications and services on top of the network, which can lead to new transportation models and business opportunities.

The outcome of this project we can achieve:

	Cashless Rides: Through our platform when a customer onboards our platform a new Ethereum wallet will be created where we will give some faucets Ethereum as a balance through which he can do his transactions so that he/she can go cashless and ride easily. With our wallet, simply recharge and enjoy hassle-free payments.

	Transparency: Since payment is done on the blockchain every user as a rider can track his payments to know about whomsoever the payment was done for every ride and as a driver, he will be able to track all the amount that had been received in the past in his wallet.

	Auto Verification: No more OTPs and no need to take your mobile out of your pocket anymore. You only need to hop in and travel, and verification will be done automatically.

	No more Peak rates! When there are abnormal conditions, we usually see there is a huge surge and fluctuations in prices even with the same supply and demand and through our platform, there will be no more surge pricing or increased charges during peak hours. Our platform brings transparency to your ride charges and you need to pay only the actual fare.
	As Big companies’ mobility companies use to earn money through commissions to make it a profitable business With This Platform, 100% of the fare that's paid will be to drivers, and will be able to take full earnings home. With a zero-commission structure, it will lead to better incomes for an individual.
